<p>An aspect ratio is a proportional relationship between an image's width and height. Essentially, it describes an image's shape. Aspect ratios are written as a formula of width to height, like this: 3:2. For example, a square image has an aspect ratio of 1:1, since the height and width are the same.</p>

<p>
    Here is where the object-fit property comes in. The object-fit property can take one of the following values:

fill - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit
contain - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension
cover - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit
none - The image is not resized
scale-down - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain
