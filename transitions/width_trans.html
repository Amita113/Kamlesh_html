<h1>The transition Property</h1>
<!-- <p>How to Use CSS Transitions?
    To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:
    
    the CSS property you want to add an effect to
    the duration of the effect
    Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.
    
    The following example shows a 100px * 100px red <div> element. The <div> element has also specified a transition effect for the width property, with a duration of 2 seconds:</p> -->
<p>Hover over the div element below, to see the transition effect:</p>
